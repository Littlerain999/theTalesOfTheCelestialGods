        <h3>The Tales of The Celestial Gods</h3><br>
        <b><i>Chapter 1: The Happenings</i></b><br>
        <br><br>
        <i>The first rays of dawn touched the quiet streets of Eryndor, the kingdom that sat on the edge of the world, untouched by the conflicts of the stronger nations. In the stillness of the morning, a child played in the dirt, his small hands shaping imaginary castles in the earth. His innocent laughter filled the air, a sound so pure it seemed to harmonize with the breeze.<br>
        <b>Then, it happened.</b><br>
        A shard—a strange, glowing fragment—fell from the heavens, landing with a soft thud at the boy's feet. The child stopped, staring at the shard with wide, curious eyes. The air grew heavier, the peace of the morning disturbed. The boy reached down to pick it up, the shard cold to the touch, its surface shimmering with an unknown energy. He looked up toward the sky, confusion turning to unease as he tried to understand where it had come from.<br>
        There was nothing. No sign of the shard's origin. Only the endless blue of the morning sky.<br>
        A chill ran down his spine, and with it, a sudden fear he could not explain.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Child [Fearful and confused, clutching the shard tightly]:</b><br>
        "Mom!"
        <br><br>
        <i>His voice cracked through the silence, high-pitched and filled with panic.<br>
        His mother, still inside their modest home, rushed to the door, hearing the fright in her son's voice.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Mother [Worried and rushing outside]:</b><br>
        "What is it, my boy?"
        <br><br>
        <i>Her eyes followed his trembling hand as he pointed to the sky. The villagers, drawn by the child's scream, emerged from their homes, gathering in the street, whispering among themselves. The boy's finger remained fixed, trembling in the air. Slowly, the people's gazes followed his hand, and then—there it was.
        <br><br>
        <b>The sky above them was breaking.</b>
        <br><br>
        A vast crack split the heavens open, jagged and violent, tearing through the fabric of the world. The light of the sun faltered, swallowed by the dark void that now loomed above them.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Villager [Whispering, filled with dread]: </b><br>
        "Gods..."
        <br><br>
        <i>The mother clutched her child, her heart racing in her chest.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Mother [Panicked, voice shaking]:</b><br>
        "What is happening?"
        <br><br>
        <i>The air thickened with an unsettling silence, and the people stood frozen, unable to speak, unable to move. The world seemed to hold its breath.<br>
        From within the void, a figure began to emerge—bright, luminous, and blinding. It descended from the rift, its light so intense it forced every eye to look away, yet no one could tear themselves from the sight. The figure hovered above them, its presence overwhelming, as if it came from a place beyond time and understanding.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Child [Voice trembling, filled with awe and fear]: </b><br>
        "Mama... it's here."
        <br><br>
        <i>No one could move. No one could speak. The people of Eryndor—so used to their quiet, simple lives—stood paralyzed in awe and fear as the figure, a being of unimaginable light, slowly descended from the heavens. The earth beneath their feet seemed to tremble, the very air thick with an unspoken power.<br>
        The figure that emerged from the crack in the sky was none other than Yue—her presence radiated with an ethereal glow, as if she was both part of the heavens and the earth itself. She stepped forward, each movement slow and deliberate, like the unfolding of time itself.<br>
        But as she took another step, a woman from the crowd screamed. Her eyes wide with terror, she crumpled to the ground, fainting from the sight of the figure above. Panic spread like wildfire. People in the streets began to run, rushing into their homes, slamming doors behind them in haste.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Yue [Calm, observing the chaos around her]:</b><br>
        "Oh... I made a terrible mistake."
        <br><br>
        <i>Her gaze softened as she watched the frightened faces of the people, realizing the fear she had unintentionally caused. A small frown tugged at her lips.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Yue [Self-reflective, speaking softly to herself]: </b><br>
        "I think... I've arrived at the place where my beloved would be born, but I didn't carefully choose the place, did I? No humans, no distractions... and yet, here I am."
        <br><br>
        <i>With a gentle exhale, she closed her eyes, and a wave of power pulsed through her. A bright flash of light exploded from her form, filling the streets and blinding the citizens of Eryndor. For a brief moment, time seemed to stand still. The air crackled, as if the world itself was holding its breath.<br>
        When the light faded and the villagers could once again see, the sky had returned to its peaceful, unbroken state. The crack was gone, and everything had returned to normal. A heavy sigh of relief echoed through the crowd. The villagers exchanged confused glances, unsure of what had just transpired, but grateful to be unharmed.<br>
        And then, as if a weight had been lifted, laughter and music filled the air as they celebrated their narrow escape. Dancing, they reveled in the joy of survival, their earlier fear now forgotten in the face of their own resilience.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Yue [Now disguised, in a cloak and a white mask with beautiful patterns, smiling softly to herself]:</b><br>
        "My king... I'm coming for you. I'm excited to see my Lord's innocent young form."
        <br><br>
        <i>Blending seamlessly into the crowd, her heart beat faster with anticipation. The journey had just begun, and her beloved awaited.
        <br><br>
        The entire world trembled with the surge of unimaginable power that rippled across the continents. Yue's arrival, though subtle in its moment, caused a great disturbance, a pulse that could be felt by all—but none knew its source. The very fabric of the world quivered under the weight of this unknown force, and yet, no one could trace where it had come from.
        <br><br>
        The people of the world, from the human kingdoms to the demon lands, found themselves gripped by confusion and fear. The skies above seemed unnaturally still, as if waiting, holding its breath for something that had already begun. Whispers spread like wildfire, carried on the wind, and rumors swirled through taverns and courts alike.
        <br><br>
        In Valoria, the capital of the strongest human kingdom, the wise and powerful King looked out over the horizon, feeling the disturbance in his bones. The Heroes' descendants, the proud lineage that had protected the kingdom for generations, were not easily swayed. They were soldiers, kings, and scholars of great power. Yet, this unknown presence stilled the very air around them.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Valorian King [Angry, his voice sharp]: </b><br>
        "An irregular... Someone who dares to oppose the will of the gods. It must be."
        <br><br>
        <i>He turned to his advisors, his eyes cold and unyielding. The power that surged had shaken his kingdom to its core, and he would not rest until it was controlled or destroyed. With a swift command, he ordered an elite group of soldiers to be assembled—ones that were trained not only in combat but in the ancient magic of their ancestors. They would search the world, tracing the source of this disturbance, no matter the cost.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Valorian King [Angry, resolute]: </b><br>
        "Irregular or not, if it is a hindrance to us, you must die."
        <br><br>
        <i>Across the sea, in the depths of Malakar, the central kingdom of the demon world, the Demon King's descendants also sensed the great power that had surged. Deep within the obsidian walls of the Malakar palace, the air was thick with dark energy. The descendants of the Demon King were known for their power and ruthlessness, and they, too, would not allow an unknown force to threaten their reign.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Demon King's Heir [Furious, his voice booming]: </b><br>
        "An irregular, you say? So it begins."
        <br><br>
        <i>The Demon King's heir, his eyes flashing with fury, clenched his fists. He, too, felt the disturbance, and like the Valorian King, he suspected the arrival of something—or someone—that opposed the laws of the world. It was not enough to simply understand the cause; it had to be eradicated. No one would defy the gods' teachings without consequence.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Demon King's Heir [Cold, commanding]: </b><br>
        "Irregular or not, if it is a hindrance to us, you must die."
        <br><br>
        <i>With a single snap of his fingers, he, too, dispatched an elite force of warriors and sorcerers, charged with the task of finding the source of this mysterious surge of power and bringing it to an end.
        <br><br>
        In the Feralden mansion, a sense of anticipation hung thick in the air. The entire household was caught up in the excitement of the arrival of the second child of the house. Preparations were underway, but little did the family know, the crack in the sky that had occurred earlier had gone unnoticed by those within the mansion, consumed by the joy of the birth.<br>
        Inside the birthing room, Lady Mirena Feralden's scream echoed through the halls, signaling the arrival of her second child. Lord Aldric Feralden, pacing nervously outside the door, anxiously ran his fingers through his hair. He glanced over at his first son, Gaius, who stood by his side with a mix of concern and impatience.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [scratching his head, voice laced with worry] :</b><br>
        "I wish I could be of more help to her. It's always so hard when they're in labor."
        <br><br>
        <b>Gaius Feralden: [grumbling] :</b><br>
        "Father, don't fret. Mother is strong. You've seen her get through so much before."
        <br><br>
        <b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [sighing] :</b><br>
        "You're right, Gaius. But this is different. She's carrying our second child. I can't help but feel a little... powerless."
        <br><br>
        <i><b>The tense moments dragged on, but soon, the sound of the door creaking open broke the silence. A nurse emerged, her face beaming with excitement.</b></i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Nurse: [smiling brightly] </b><br>
        "Congratulations, Sire! The young Lord has been born!"
        <br><br>
        <i>At the news, both father and son's faces lit up with relief and joy. Without another moment's hesitation, Lord Aldric Feralden hurried into the room, with Gaius trailing closely behind.
        <br><br>
        Inside, Lady Mirena sat on the bed, holding their newborn son in her arms, a soft smile of pure love and joy gracing her face. The glow in her eyes was unmistakable as she gazed lovingly at the child.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Lady Mirena Feralden: [tears brimming in her eyes, whispering gently] :</b><br>
        "My son..."
        <br><br>
        <b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [kneeling beside the bed, his voice thick with emotion] </b><br>
        "Mirena... He's perfect. Our little Elias."
        <br><br>
        <i>He embraced his wife warmly, his heart overflowing with pride and joy. The couple exchanged soft words of congratulations and sweet nothings, marveling at the new life they had brought into the world. In that moment, everything felt right, as if all the struggles and worries of the outside world had faded away.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [looking at the baby, a gentle smile curling his lips] </b><br>
        "Elias... Our second son, born to us. May he grow strong and wise."
        <br><br>
        <b>Lady Mirena Feralden: [nodding softly] </b><br>
        "Elias... A name befitting our little one. May he carry the light of our family's future."
        <br><br>
        <i>As they gazed down at their son, the world outside seemed distant, unaware of the powerful forces in motion. The crack in the sky, the strange surge of power that had been felt across the world, all of it seemed irrelevant in this moment. For the Feralden family, their world had just expanded with the arrival of a new life—one they hoped would carry their legacy into the future.<br>
        As the family marveled at the newborn's peaceful slumber, a strange yet undeniable truth lingered in the air. The boy, Elias Feralden, was not just any child.
        <br><br>
        <b>He was The Black—reborn once more.</b>

            <h3>The Tales of The Celestial Gods</h3><br><br>
            <b><i>Chapter 0: Reincarnation's Promise and The Beginning</i></b><br>
            <br><br>
            <i>In the vast, starry expanse of the universe, where galaxies shimmered like diamonds on a dark velvet canvas, two celestial beings stood—one cloaked in black, the other in white. These beings, embodiments of opposite forces, were eternal partners—forever bound, forever intertwined. <br>
            The Black, known as the God of Destruction and Void, exuded an aura of infinite power and mystery. The White, the Goddess of Life and Creation, radiated warmth and divine grace. Together, they had existed for eons, reincarnating countless times, finding each other across lifetimes, and falling in love over and over again. Their bond was unbreakable. <br>
            Today, they stood hand in hand, gazing at the beauty of the universe they had shaped and ruled over, their love as unwavering as the stars themselves.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (softly, with a gentle smile):</b><br>
            “My Dearest… how many times have we fallen for each other across the endless cycles of reincarnation? How many lives have we shared, hand in hand, heart to heart?”
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (with a teasing grin):</b><br>
            “Ah, my love, I couldn't count the number of times we've crossed paths. And truth be told, I couldn't care less about the number. All that matters is you, The White, are always the one I desire above all.”
            <br><br>
            White's face flushed pink as her heart swelled with affection. She turned to her eternal companion, her voice soft and filled with wonder.
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (blushing, with a playful tone):</b><br>
            “Oh, my King… forgive me for my curiosity. I wonder, how did I fall for you each time, in every life we've shared? How is it that I always find my way to you?”
            <br><br>
            <i>The Black chuckled, his deep voice full of warmth, and leaned forward to kiss her forehead, his touch tender and full of affection.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (teasingly):</b><br>
            “Ah, my eternal love… shall we make a game of it? Perhaps in the next life, we'll see who falls for whom first. I shall reincarnate and wait for you to find me. It will be a test, my dear.”
            <br><br>
            The White, still in his embrace, hesitated for a moment before pulling away slightly, her hands gently gripping his. Her expression grew serious, her eyes filled with longing.
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (softly, with a touch of sadness):</b><br>
            “My Lord… I do not wish to be separated from you any longer. Not like this. Not in endless cycles of waiting. I cannot bear the loneliness of it.”<br>
            “I want to be with you in this life… from the very beginning. No more reincarnations, no more separations. Just you and I, together, forever.”<br>
            <br><br>
            A tear shimmered in the corner of her eye, but she quickly wiped it away, trying to hide her vulnerability. <br>
            The Black's heart softened at the sight of her tears. He pulled her into a tight embrace, his voice filled with apology and tenderness. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (gently):</b><br>
            “My dearest goddess… forgive me. I have been thoughtless in my words. I have been selfish in my desire to play this game, but I now understand. I, The Black, promise to fulfill all your desires.”
            “Tell me, my queen, what do you wish of me?” <br>
            <br><br>
            The White smiled softly, though her eyes still shimmered with unshed tears. She pushed him playfully away, her expression turning more serious again. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (with a gentle giggle):</b><br>
            “You must keep your promise, my love. For now, I desire that you remain in your divine form, but I—”<br>
            “I wish to reincarnate into a human body. I will remain by your side from birth, watching you grow, seeing you become the man you are destined to be.”<br>
            <br><br>
            The Black's eyes widened slightly at her words, his face flushing with a mix of surprise and affection. He smiled, though, a little embarrassed by her unexpected request. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (with a soft laugh):</b><br>
            “Very well, my dearest. If this is what you wish, I will honor it. The Black will do as you command, as always.”<br>
            <br><br>
            A few moments passed in silence before the Black turned to her, his expression more serious as he spoke again. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black:</b><br>
            “The reincarnation process is about to begin. Before I go, tell me… what name should I call you in this life?”<br>
            <br><br>
            The White's eyes sparkled, a soft smile curving her lips as she thought for a moment.<br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White:</b><br>
            “In this life, I shall be known as Yue. It is a name that reflects the moon, something eternal and constant, much like my love for you.”<br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (with a smile):</b><br>
            “Then, my Yue, I will go now.”
            <br><br>
            They shared one last, passionate kiss, their embrace filled with a promise of love and reunion. The Black's form began to dissipate, leaving only a trail of sparkling stardust in his wake.
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (whispering softly to herself):</b><br>
            “Please, wait for me, my King…”
            <br><br>
            <i>As the Black vanished, the White looked up at the sky, watching as a meteor shower streaked across the heavens. With a solemn nod, she prepared herself for what was to come.
            She reached out, her hands glowing with celestial light. Slowly, she compressed her divine form, condensing her immense power into a smaller, human body. Her wings, once vast and powerful, shifted into delicate forms—five pairs of wings, alternating in black and white, now small and graceful.
            Her crown-like aura swirled and melted into a more human form, though still radiating with divine energy. Her new body, now human in appearance, was beautiful and elegant—her hair silver-white, her eyes a deep, penetrating purple.
            With a sigh, she looked at her reflection in the mirror that appeared before her. A soft smile touched her lips.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (murmuring):</b><br>
            “With this form, my love will surely be pleased…”
            <br><br>
            After a brief pause, she focused on the coordinates of The Black, finding his location across the realms. A surge of magic rippled through her as she prepared a teleportation spell. Her wings and divine aura retracted into her body, leaving behind only a human appearance.
            <br><br>
            <i>With a final whispered vow, she activated the spell.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (determined, with a smile):</b><br>
            “I am coming for you, my love. Just you wait for me…”
            <br><br>
            The air around her shimmered, and in a flash of light, she was gone, her path now set to find The Black in this new world.
