        <h4><i>Chapter 2: The Celebration of Life</i></h4>
        <br><br>
        The night after the sky-shattering incident, the kingdom buzzed with a mixture of tension and celebration. While the day’s mysterious events had left many shaken, the joyous news of the birth of the young lord, Elias, quickly captured the people's attention. Whispers of hope and renewal spread like wildfire, reaching every corner of the land.
        <br><br>
        Lord Aldric Feralden’s mansion became the center of festivities. Known for his fairness and respect for all, Lord Aldric extended invitations to nobles and commoners alike. It was a rare act of unity, and the gesture had not gone unnoticed.
        <br><br>
        The mansion gleamed under the glow of lanterns, their golden light illuminating the lush courtyard and the bustling streets beyond. Inside, music filled the grand hall, mingling with the clinking of glasses and bursts of laughter. Nobles dressed in elaborate silks stood in small, self-contained groups, their every gesture calculated. Meanwhile, commoners in their best attire admired the splendor around them, their faces a mix of awe and delight.
        <br><br>
        By the banquet table, a sudden crash shattered the harmonious scene. A delicate glass, its surface etched with intricate patterns, lay in jagged shards on the floor.
        <br><br>
        “You clumsy fool!” A nobleman’s voice rose above the chatter, sharp and accusing. His face, flushed with anger, turned toward a startled commoner standing nearby. “Do you have any idea how much that glass is worth?”
        <br><br>
        “I didn’t touch it!” the commoner shot back, his voice trembling yet resolute. “You knocked it over!”
        <br><br>
        “Lies!” The noble’s tone dripped with disdain as he pointed an accusing finger. “Your kind has no place among such finery.”
        <br><br>
        The air grew thick with unease as murmurs rippled through the crowd. Some nobles sneered, while a few commoners exchanged nervous glances.
        <br><br>
        In the shadows, a cloaked woman observed the scene, her presence unnoticed. The faint flicker of lantern light caught the intricate patterns of the mask she wore, but her expression remained hidden. She silently observed the incident that unfolded infront her.
        <br><br>
        Before the argument could escalate further, the grand doors of the mansion swung open. Lord Aldric Feralden stepped into view, his imposing figure framed by the warm glow of light spilling from the hall. The crowd fell silent as his sharp gaze swept across the room, taking in the scene with quiet authority.
        <br><br>
        "Enough." His voice carried effortlessly over the gathering, calm yet commanding.
        <br><br>
        At his side, Lady Mirena stood with serene grace. Her presence seemed to soothe the rising tension, her gaze soft yet unyielding. She looked toward the commoner, her expression unreadable but kind, then shifted her focus to the nobleman, whose haughty demeanor faltered under her scrutiny.
        <br><br>
        Before either could speak, the sound of approaching hooves echoed through the courtyard. The heavy gates creaked open, revealing the royal wagon, its crest shining in the moonlight.
        <br><br>
        The crowd parted as the wagon came to a halt. Gasps rippled through the gathering as the King and Queen of Eryndor stepped out, their movements regal and deliberate. Their children followed, each poised and elegant.
        <br><br>
        Lady Mirena inclined her head in greeting, her voice carrying warmth and respect. “Your Majesties, welcome to our home. It is an honor to have you join us on this joyous occasion.”
        <br><br>
        The King offered a measured nod, his expression calm but kind. “The honor is ours, Lady Mirena. Tonight, we celebrate not just a birth but the hope it brings to our kingdom.”
        <br><br>
        As the royal family moved forward to greet the hosts, the earlier conflict dissolved, leaving only a lingering tension in the air. The cloaked woman, still hidden among the crowd, allowed herself a small, fleeting smile. Her gaze flickered toward the mansion’s upper floors, where the faint cry of a newborn could be heard.
        <br><br>
        “My lord,” she whispered, her voice soft and reverent, “you have returned.”<br>
        As the lord and the royal family took their seats, the hall buzzed with quiet anticipation. Rising to his feet, Lord Aldric raised a gleaming goblet of wine. His voice, firm yet warm, carried through the grand hall. "Let the celebration begin!"
        <br><br>
        At his command, the mansion doors opened, and a parade of servants entered with practiced grace, balancing trays of wine and delicacies. The air filled with the sound of clinking glasses and lively chatter as the joyous atmosphere took hold.
        <br><br>
        In the corner of the hall, a cloaked figure in black observed silently. Yue, her face obscured by an intricately designed mask, remained unnoticed in the shadows. Beneath the mask, her vibrant amethyst eyes darted across the room, catching every movement. Despite the joy around her, her presence was subdued—a quiet guardian amidst the revelry.
        <br><br>
        After some time, Lord Aldric rose again, his commanding presence drawing attention once more. He raised his glass high. "I thank you all for gathering here today. This is a day of great joy, for today, my son Elias was born! Let us toast to the kingdom and to Elias!"
        <br><br>
        A chorus of cheers erupted as glasses clinked, and a radiant wave of goodwill swept the room. However, the spirited celebration was soon interrupted by the faint sound of a baby’s cry from the upper floors. Heads turned as the tiny, plaintive wail reached every ear.
        <br><br>
        Amused and intrigued, the crowd murmured among themselves, and some began to express a desire to see the young lord. Smiling with pride, Lord Aldric nodded. "It would be my honor to share this moment with you. Bring my son here!"
        <br><br>
        Maids were swiftly dispatched to retrieve the little lord. Yue’s eyes glimmered beneath her mask, her gaze fixed on the stairs with unshakable intensity. The faint, hopeful whisper escaped her lips, inaudible in the bustling hall. "My lord... finally."
        <br><br>
        She shifted slightly, her heart racing beneath the heavy fabric of her cloak. Yet, the faintest flicker of doubt crossed her face. "This body... it’s still too unstable. Why now of all times? I should have prepared better. Five more days, and it would’ve been perfect." Her hands tightened slightly as she whispered with a bittersweet ache, "My lord, I miss you."
        <br><br>
        After a few moments, the maids descended the staircase carrying a cradle adorned with soft silks. Within it lay Elias, the little lord, fast asleep. The sight drew a collective sigh of admiration from the gathered guests. His peaceful expression, soft tufts of dark hair, and chubby hands peeking from beneath the blanket captured every heart.
        <br><br>
        Guests formed an orderly line, eager to catch a glimpse of the newborn. Each face softened with warmth and awe, and even the most stoic of nobles found themselves smiling. Yue watched from her shadowed corner, her hands trembling faintly. "So close," she murmured, her voice breaking with suppressed longing.
        <br><br>
        As the line of admirers thinned, Elias was carried to a quieter room away from the noise to ensure his rest. The noble children and the royal offspring expressed their desire to see the baby as well, but their mothers gently dissuaded them, fearing they might accidentally wake the little lord.
        <br><br>
        Among them, the five-year-old first princess of the kingdom lingered a moment longer than the rest. Her piercing gaze, far too perceptive for her age, seemed to linger on the cradle. As if sensing something beyond the physical, she tilted her head curiously. "It feels like... there are two people in him," she whispered softly to herself, her tiny brow furrowing in thought.
        <br><br>
        Her steps faltered briefly before she turned to follow the other children, her curiosity still lingering but unspoken.<br>
        The night was drowned in the vibrant celebration, the faces of many alight with joy and laughter. But amidst the merriment, one person stood apart, her heart heavy with longing. Yue, unable to approach her lord due to the instability of her form, silently left the festivities with a sadness that shadowed her every step. She made her way through a quiet alley, her heart weighed down by the distance that still separated her from Elias.
        <br><br>
        With a breath, she soared high into the sky, her wings unfurling in the vast expanse above the kingdom. A spell of invisibility surrounded her, cloaking her presence from the world below. Slowly, the mask and cloak she wore vanished, her divine form revealing itself to the heavens.
        <br><br>
        Five pairs of wings shimmered in the moonless night, alternating in black as dark as the abyss and white as bright as the stars themselves. Above her head, an elegant crown appeared, a symbol of both grace and authority. The night sky stretched out before her, an ocean of darkness as the new moon shone not.
        <br><br>
        Yue’s heart ached as she gazed up at the empty expanse. "The night is darkest without the moon," she whispered, her voice soft but filled with longing, "just as I am without you, my lord." Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Even though it’s only been a day since we parted, I miss you already."
        <br><br>
        A single tear slipped from her eye, falling to the earth below. As it touched the ground, the tear ignited with the power of her divine essence, transforming into an ethereal aurora that spread across the kingdom, painting the sky with vibrant colors. The sight was beautiful, but to Yue, it only deepened her sorrow.
        <br><br>
        The kingdom of Eryndor was left in confusion, some gazing in wonder, others in alarm. Only Yue remained untouched by the spectacle, her soul heavy with the desire to be reunited with her lord. She quickly concealed her wings and crown, shrouding herself in the cloak and mask once more, and flew back to Lord Aldric's mansion. Unseen by guards or servants, she made her way through the halls, her heart pounding in her chest as she approached Elias' room.
        <br><br>
        Standing before the door, Yue hesitated, the rush of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. But she had come this far. Slowly, she placed her hand on the door handle, the cool metal grounding her for a moment. She carefully checked the room, sensing no one else inside. With a nervous breath, she turned the handle and entered.
        <br><br>
        Her heart skipped a beat as her gaze fell upon the cradle where Elias slept peacefully. The sight of him—the little lord, her lord—stirred something deep within her. She placed a hand over her chest, feeling her heartbeat quicken with nerves and excitement. She slowly moved toward the cradle, pausing once more to take in the sight of her lord in his most innocent, pure form.
        <br><br>
        Kneeling beside the cradle, she reached out to gently poke Elias' cheek, but her hand froze midway. She suddenly realized her unstable form could harm him, and she quickly tried to retract her hand. However, before she could, Elias’ tiny fingers grasped her finger, his eyes fluttering open. Yue’s heart caught in her throat.
        <br><br>
        Startled, she tried to pull away, but Elias began to cry, a soft, pitiful sound that tugged at her heartstrings. Not knowing what else to do, Yue gently offered her finger once more, and Elias, still half-asleep, giggled and gave her a sweet smile. The warmth of his presence filled Yue with joy, and she realized that despite the reincarnation, her lord recognized her—perhaps not in full, but in spirit.
        <br><br>
        She removed her mask and gazed down at Elias with a warm, affectionate smile, her eyes shining with both joy and tears. Even as a little boy, Elias’ reaction was one of awe, his face lighting up with wonder at her beauty.
        <br><br>
        Then, a sudden surge of dark energy poured from Elias’ body, shocking Yue. Before she could comprehend the power, the energy flowed too quickly, entering her own body. The divine essence she carried stabilized her form almost instantly. Her unstable body, once a burden, became strong and whole again.
        <br><br>
        Tears of relief welled in Yue’s eyes as she realized the depth of her lord’s power. She smiled gently, her heart overwhelmed with emotion. Leaning down, she kissed Elias’ forehead, her lips soft and tender.
        <br><br>
        For a moment, they played together, laughing in the stillness of the night. The connection between them was undeniable, and for Yue, it was a moment of pure joy, a fleeting escape from the pain that had once gripped her.
        <br><br>
        But the peace was interrupted when Lady Mirena, Elias’ birth mother, awoke from her sleep. Concerned for her son, she quietly made her way to his room. Her heart nearly stopped when she saw the figure in black near Elias’ cradle.
        <br><br>
        "Who are you?" Lady Mirena asked, her voice cautious but not hostile.
        <br><br>
        Yue, startled by the question, turned slowly. As she saw Lady Mirena, the birth mother of her lord, a deep respect filled her. She bowed, her body lowered in reverence. "I apologize for intruding," she said softly. "I never intended to cause harm."
        <br><br>
        Lady Mirena, her heart racing, observed Yue carefully. Despite the cloaked figure’s presence near her son, there was no malice in her demeanor, only a profound gentleness. The tension eased from Lady Mirena’s chest as she turned to the cradle. Elias, now smiling up at Yue, reached out his tiny hands.
        <br><br>
        A soft gasp escaped Lady Mirena’s lips as she watched the scene unfold. She looked back at Yue, but before she could speak further, Yue stood to leave, bowing once again.
        <br><br>
        "May your family remain blessed, my lady," Yue whispered, her voice full of warmth and respect. "And may my Lord and your son shine as the brightest light in this land."
        <br><br>
        Before Lady Mirena could respond, a white feather floated in front of her, blocking her vision. When it settled, Yue was gone, vanished as silently as she had come.
        <br><br>
        Lady Mirena, still processing the encounter, looked down at her son, finding him peacefully asleep with a contented smile on his face. The words "my Lord" echoed in her mind, a lingering mystery she couldn’t quite shake.
        <br><br>
        Outside, the aurora that had painted the skies remained, casting a soft, mesmerizing glow over the kingdom. Lady Mirena’s gaze lingered on the ethereal light before she returned her focus to her son.
        <br><br>
        And far away, Yue, smiling softly to herself, whispered under her breath, "I’ll look forward to our days together in this life, my Lord."

        <h4><i>Chapter 1: The Happenings</i></h4>
        <br><br>
        <i>The first rays of dawn touched the quiet streets of Eryndor, the kingdom that sat on the edge of the world, untouched by the conflicts of the stronger nations. In the stillness of the morning, a child played in the dirt, his small hands shaping imaginary castles in the earth. His innocent laughter filled the air, a sound so pure it seemed to harmonize with the breeze.<br>
        <b>Then, it happened.</b><br>
        A shard—a strange, glowing fragment—fell from the heavens, landing with a soft thud at the boy's feet. The child stopped, staring at the shard with wide, curious eyes. The air grew heavier, the peace of the morning disturbed. The boy reached down to pick it up, the shard cold to the touch, its surface shimmering with an unknown energy. He looked up toward the sky, confusion turning to unease as he tried to understand where it had come from.<br>
        There was nothing. No sign of the shard's origin. Only the endless blue of the morning sky.<br>
        A chill ran down his spine, and with it, a sudden fear he could not explain.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Child [Fearful and confused, clutching the shard tightly]:</b><br>
        "Mom!"
        <br><br>
        <i>His voice cracked through the silence, high-pitched and filled with panic.<br>
        His mother, still inside their modest home, rushed to the door, hearing the fright in her son's voice.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Mother [Worried and rushing outside]:</b><br>
        "What is it, my boy?"
        <br><br>
        <i>Her eyes followed his trembling hand as he pointed to the sky. The villagers, drawn by the child's scream, emerged from their homes, gathering in the street, whispering among themselves. The boy's finger remained fixed, trembling in the air. Slowly, the people's gazes followed his hand, and then—there it was.
        <br><br>
        <b>The sky above them was breaking.</b>
        <br><br>
        A vast crack split the heavens open, jagged and violent, tearing through the fabric of the world. The light of the sun faltered, swallowed by the dark void that now loomed above them.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Villager [Whispering, filled with dread]: </b><br>
        "Gods..."
        <br><br>
        <i>The mother clutched her child, her heart racing in her chest.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Mother [Panicked, voice shaking]:</b><br>
        "What is happening?"
        <br><br>
        <i>The air thickened with an unsettling silence, and the people stood frozen, unable to speak, unable to move. The world seemed to hold its breath.<br>
        From within the void, a figure began to emerge—bright, luminous, and blinding. It descended from the rift, its light so intense it forced every eye to look away, yet no one could tear themselves from the sight. The figure hovered above them, its presence overwhelming, as if it came from a place beyond time and understanding.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Child [Voice trembling, filled with awe and fear]: </b><br>
        "Mama... it's here."
        <br><br>
        <i>No one could move. No one could speak. The people of Eryndor—so used to their quiet, simple lives—stood paralyzed in awe and fear as the figure, a being of unimaginable light, slowly descended from the heavens. The earth beneath their feet seemed to tremble, the very air thick with an unspoken power.<br>
        The figure that emerged from the crack in the sky was none other than Yue—her presence radiated with an ethereal glow, as if she was both part of the heavens and the earth itself. She stepped forward, each movement slow and deliberate, like the unfolding of time itself.<br>
        But as she took another step, a woman from the crowd screamed. Her eyes wide with terror, she crumpled to the ground, fainting from the sight of the figure above. Panic spread like wildfire. People in the streets began to run, rushing into their homes, slamming doors behind them in haste.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Yue [Calm, observing the chaos around her]:</b><br>
        "Oh... I made a terrible mistake."
        <br><br>
        <i>Her gaze softened as she watched the frightened faces of the people, realizing the fear she had unintentionally caused. A small frown tugged at her lips.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Yue [Self-reflective, speaking softly to herself]: </b><br>
        "I think... I've arrived at the place where my beloved would be born, but I didn't carefully choose the place, did I? No humans, no distractions... and yet, here I am."
        <br><br>
        <i>With a gentle exhale, she closed her eyes, and a wave of power pulsed through her. A bright flash of light exploded from her form, filling the streets and blinding the citizens of Eryndor. For a brief moment, time seemed to stand still. The air crackled, as if the world itself was holding its breath.<br>
        When the light faded and the villagers could once again see, the sky had returned to its peaceful, unbroken state. The crack was gone, and everything had returned to normal. A heavy sigh of relief echoed through the crowd. The villagers exchanged confused glances, unsure of what had just transpired, but grateful to be unharmed.<br>
        And then, as if a weight had been lifted, laughter and music filled the air as they celebrated their narrow escape. Dancing, they reveled in the joy of survival, their earlier fear now forgotten in the face of their own resilience.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Yue [Now disguised, in a cloak and a white mask with beautiful patterns, smiling softly to herself]:</b><br>
        "My king... I'm coming for you. I'm excited to see my Lord's innocent young form."
        <br><br>
        <i>Blending seamlessly into the crowd, her heart beat faster with anticipation. The journey had just begun, and her beloved awaited.
        <br><br>
        The entire world trembled with the surge of unimaginable power that rippled across the continents. Yue's arrival, though subtle in its moment, caused a great disturbance, a pulse that could be felt by all—but none knew its source. The very fabric of the world quivered under the weight of this unknown force, and yet, no one could trace where it had come from.
        <br><br>
        The people of the world, from the human kingdoms to the demon lands, found themselves gripped by confusion and fear. The skies above seemed unnaturally still, as if waiting, holding its breath for something that had already begun. Whispers spread like wildfire, carried on the wind, and rumors swirled through taverns and courts alike.
        <br><br>
        In Valoria, the capital of the strongest human kingdom, the wise and powerful King looked out over the horizon, feeling the disturbance in his bones. The Heroes' descendants, the proud lineage that had protected the kingdom for generations, were not easily swayed. They were soldiers, kings, and scholars of great power. Yet, this unknown presence stilled the very air around them.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Valorian King [Angry, his voice sharp]: </b><br>
        "An irregular... Someone who dares to oppose the will of the gods. It must be."
        <br><br>
        <i>He turned to his advisors, his eyes cold and unyielding. The power that surged had shaken his kingdom to its core, and he would not rest until it was controlled or destroyed. With a swift command, he ordered an elite group of soldiers to be assembled—ones that were trained not only in combat but in the ancient magic of their ancestors. They would search the world, tracing the source of this disturbance, no matter the cost.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Valorian King [Angry, resolute]: </b><br>
        "Irregular or not, if it is a hindrance to us, you must die."
        <br><br>
        <i>Across the sea, in the depths of Malakar, the central kingdom of the demon world, the Demon King's descendants also sensed the great power that had surged. Deep within the obsidian walls of the Malakar palace, the air was thick with dark energy. The descendants of the Demon King were known for their power and ruthlessness, and they, too, would not allow an unknown force to threaten their reign.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Demon King's Heir [Furious, his voice booming]: </b><br>
        "An irregular, you say? So it begins."
        <br><br>
        <i>The Demon King's heir, his eyes flashing with fury, clenched his fists. He, too, felt the disturbance, and like the Valorian King, he suspected the arrival of something—or someone—that opposed the laws of the world. It was not enough to simply understand the cause; it had to be eradicated. No one would defy the gods' teachings without consequence.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Demon King's Heir [Cold, commanding]: </b><br>
        "Irregular or not, if it is a hindrance to us, you must die."
        <br><br>
        <i>With a single snap of his fingers, he, too, dispatched an elite force of warriors and sorcerers, charged with the task of finding the source of this mysterious surge of power and bringing it to an end.
        <br><br>
        In the Feralden mansion, a sense of anticipation hung thick in the air. The entire household was caught up in the excitement of the arrival of the second child of the house. Preparations were underway, but little did the family know, the crack in the sky that had occurred earlier had gone unnoticed by those within the mansion, consumed by the joy of the birth.<br>
        Inside the birthing room, Lady Mirena Feralden's scream echoed through the halls, signaling the arrival of her second child. Lord Aldric Feralden, pacing nervously outside the door, anxiously ran his fingers through his hair. He glanced over at his first son, Gaius, who stood by his side with a mix of concern and impatience.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [scratching his head, voice laced with worry] :</b><br>
        "I wish I could be of more help to her. It's always so hard when they're in labor."
        <br><br>
        <b>Gaius Feralden: [grumbling] :</b><br>
        "Father, don't fret. Mother is strong. You've seen her get through so much before."
        <br><br>
        <b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [sighing] :</b><br>
        "You're right, Gaius. But this is different. She's carrying our second child. I can't help but feel a little... powerless."
        <br><br>
        <i><b>The tense moments dragged on, but soon, the sound of the door creaking open broke the silence. A nurse emerged, her face beaming with excitement.</b></i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Nurse: [smiling brightly] </b><br>
        "Congratulations, Sire! The young Lord has been born!"
        <br><br>
        <i>At the news, both father and son's faces lit up with relief and joy. Without another moment's hesitation, Lord Aldric Feralden hurried into the room, with Gaius trailing closely behind.
        <br><br>
        Inside, Lady Mirena sat on the bed, holding their newborn son in her arms, a soft smile of pure love and joy gracing her face. The glow in her eyes was unmistakable as she gazed lovingly at the child.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>Lady Mirena Feralden: [tears brimming in her eyes, whispering gently] :</b><br>
        "My son..."
        <br><br>
        <b>Lord Aldric Feralden: [kneeling beside the bed, his voice thick with emotion] </b><br>
        "Mirena... He's perfect. Our little Elias."

        <i>He embraced his wife warmly, his heart overflowing with pride and joy. The couple exchanged soft words of congratulations and sweet nothings, marveling at the new life they had brought into the world. In that moment, everything felt right, as if all the struggles and worries of the outside world had faded away.</i>

        "Elias... Our second son, born to us. May he grow strong and wise."

        <b>Lady Mirena Feralden: [nodding softly] </b><br>
        "Elias... A name befitting our little one. May he carry the light of our family's future."

        <i>As they gazed down at their son, the world outside seemed distant, unaware of the powerful forces in motion. The crack in the sky, the strange surge of power that had been felt across the world, all of it seemed irrelevant in this moment. For the Feralden family, their world had just expanded with the arrival of a new life—one they hoped would carry their legacy into the future.<br>
        As the family marveled at the newborn's peaceful slumber, a strange yet undeniable truth lingered in the air. The boy, Elias Feralden, was not just any child.

            <h3>The Tales of The Celestial Gods</h3><br><br>
            <h4><i>Chapter 0: Reincarnation's Promise and The Beginning</i></h4>
            <br><br>
            <i>In the vast, starry expanse of the universe, where galaxies shimmered like diamonds on a dark velvet canvas, two celestial beings stood—one cloaked in black, the other in white. These beings, embodiments of opposite forces, were eternal partners—forever bound, forever intertwined. <br>
            The Black, known as the God of Destruction and Void, exuded an aura of infinite power and mystery. The White, the Goddess of Life and Creation, radiated warmth and divine grace. Together, they had existed for eons, reincarnating countless times, finding each other across lifetimes, and falling in love over and over again. Their bond was unbreakable. <br>
            Today, they stood hand in hand, gazing at the beauty of the universe they had shaped and ruled over, their love as unwavering as the stars themselves.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (softly, with a gentle smile):</b><br>
            “My Dearest… how many times have we fallen for each other across the endless cycles of reincarnation? How many lives have we shared, hand in hand, heart to heart?”
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (with a teasing grin):</b><br>
            “Ah, my love, I couldn't count the number of times we've crossed paths. And truth be told, I couldn't care less about the number. All that matters is you, The White, are always the one I desire above all.”
            <br><br>
            White's face flushed pink as her heart swelled with affection. She turned to her eternal companion, her voice soft and filled with wonder.
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (blushing, with a playful tone):</b><br>
            “Oh, my King… forgive me for my curiosity. I wonder, how did I fall for you each time, in every life we've shared? How is it that I always find my way to you?”
            <br><br>
            <i>The Black chuckled, his deep voice full of warmth, and leaned forward to kiss her forehead, his touch tender and full of affection.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (teasingly):</b><br>
            “Ah, my eternal love… shall we make a game of it? Perhaps in the next life, we'll see who falls for whom first. I shall reincarnate and wait for you to find me. It will be a test, my dear.”
            <br><br>
            The White, still in his embrace, hesitated for a moment before pulling away slightly, her hands gently gripping his. Her expression grew serious, her eyes filled with longing.
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (softly, with a touch of sadness):</b><br>
            “My Lord… I do not wish to be separated from you any longer. Not like this. Not in endless cycles of waiting. I cannot bear the loneliness of it.”<br>
            “I want to be with you in this life… from the very beginning. No more reincarnations, no more separations. Just you and I, together, forever.”<br>
            <br><br>
            A tear shimmered in the corner of her eye, but she quickly wiped it away, trying to hide her vulnerability. <br>
            The Black's heart softened at the sight of her tears. He pulled her into a tight embrace, his voice filled with apology and tenderness. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (gently):</b><br>
            “My dearest goddess… forgive me. I have been thoughtless in my words. I have been selfish in my desire to play this game, but I now understand. I, The Black, promise to fulfill all your desires.”
            “Tell me, my queen, what do you wish of me?” <br>
            <br><br>
            The White smiled softly, though her eyes still shimmered with unshed tears. She pushed him playfully away, her expression turning more serious again. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (with a gentle giggle):</b><br>
            “You must keep your promise, my love. For now, I desire that you remain in your divine form, but I—”<br>
            “I wish to reincarnate into a human body. I will remain by your side from birth, watching you grow, seeing you become the man you are destined to be.”<br>
            <br><br>
            The Black's eyes widened slightly at her words, his face flushing with a mix of surprise and affection. He smiled, though, a little embarrassed by her unexpected request. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (with a soft laugh):</b><br>
            “Very well, my dearest. If this is what you wish, I will honor it. The Black will do as you command, as always.”<br>
            <br><br>
            A few moments passed in silence before the Black turned to her, his expression more serious as he spoke again. <br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black:</b><br>
            “The reincarnation process is about to begin. Before I go, tell me… what name should I call you in this life?”<br>
            <br><br>
            The White's eyes sparkled, a soft smile curving her lips as she thought for a moment.<br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White:</b><br>
            “In this life, I shall be known as Yue. It is a name that reflects the moon, something eternal and constant, much like my love for you.”<br>
            <br><br>
            <b>The Black (with a smile):</b><br>
            “Then, my Yue, I will go now.”
            <br><br>
            They shared one last, passionate kiss, their embrace filled with a promise of love and reunion. The Black's form began to dissipate, leaving only a trail of sparkling stardust in his wake.
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (whispering softly to herself):</b><br>
            “Please, wait for me, my King…”
            <br><br>
            <i>As the Black vanished, the White looked up at the sky, watching as a meteor shower streaked across the heavens. With a solemn nod, she prepared herself for what was to come.
            She reached out, her hands glowing with celestial light. Slowly, she compressed her divine form, condensing her immense power into a smaller, human body. Her wings, once vast and powerful, shifted into delicate forms—five pairs of wings, alternating in black and white, now small and graceful.
            Her crown-like aura swirled and melted into a more human form, though still radiating with divine energy. Her new body, now human in appearance, was beautiful and elegant—her hair silver-white, her eyes a deep, penetrating purple.
            With a sigh, she looked at her reflection in the mirror that appeared before her. A soft smile touched her lips.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (murmuring):</b><br>
            “With this form, my love will surely be pleased…”
            <br><br>
            After a brief pause, she focused on the coordinates of The Black, finding his location across the realms. A surge of magic rippled through her as she prepared a teleportation spell. Her wings and divine aura retracted into her body, leaving behind only a human appearance.
            <br><br>
            <i>With a final whispered vow, she activated the spell.</i>
            <br><br>
            <b>The White (determined, with a smile):</b><br>
            “I am coming for you, my love. Just you wait for me…”
            <br><br>
            The air around her shimmered, and in a flash of light, she was gone, her path now set to find The Black in this new world.
